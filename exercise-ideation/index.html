<p>Design a calculator. Standard, scientific, or specialty calculator for something such as a mortgage? Is it for a phone, a tablet, a web app?</p>
<p>Design a 404 page. Does it suit the brand&#39;s style? Is it user-friendly? It might sound mundane, but not evertyhing can be flash or glamorous. Every day millions of people will be landing on 404 pages. You have an opportunity to help them in a way that&#39;s useful and asthetically pleasing.(It&#39;s up to you!)</p>
<p>Countdown Timer
Hint: Design a Countdown Timer. Is it for an app? An interface for an oven? A sport related countdown? A launch countdown for NASA?</p>
<p>On/Off Switch
Hint: Design an On/Off Switch. Consider what&#39;s being turned on/off and how it should be done.</p>
<p>Search
Hint: Design something search related. It could be a search bar, an advanced search window, a search function, etc. (As always, it&#39;s up to you!) Don&#39;t forget to share on Dribbble and/or Twitter with #dailyui when you&#39;re done.</p>
<p>Calendar
Hint: Design a Calendar focused element. Is it for scheduling an appointment? A reservation, flight, hotel, or concert calendar? Is it a calendar reminder feature? For email or something else entirely?</p>
<p>ToDo List</p>
<p>Breadcrumbs
Hint: NOT the edible kind. ;) Although a seemingly small detail, breadcrumbs are quite necessary yet often neglected in terms of appearance and functionality. And to truly achieve great design sense and skills you need to consider even the smallest details.</p>

<p>Schedule</p>
<p>Design Hint...</p>
<p>What are you creating a schedule for? Is it for a sports team? A band planning their concert tour? Is it a personal travel schedule?</p>
